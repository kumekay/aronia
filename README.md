# Aronia Keyboard

A 36-key, ultra-compact, foldable, ergonomic keyboard. It's designed to be as small as possible while remaining comfortable for typing. When folded, the keyboard measures only 100x100x12mm and weighs 115g.

> [!WARNING]
> The current prototypes are functional but not perfect. Soldering the switches on a hot plate is extremely challenging. Be prepared for multiple attempts and have spare switches on hand.

## Hardware

The hardware is designed in the [KiCad](https.org/) EDA suite. The PCB is designed with components available from the JLCPCB assembly service. The power supply and MCU module selection are heavily inspired by the [nRFMicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro) project.

## Firmware

The firmware is based on the [ZMK project](https://zmkfirmware.dev/) and uses a layout based on [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku). The source code is available at [https://github.com/kumekay/miryoku_zmk](https://github.com/kumekay/miryoku_zmk).
